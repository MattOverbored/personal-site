Welcome to my blog. I've been wanting to write more for a while and this is finally the place to do it.

## What to expect

I'll write about whatever I'm into at the time. That's mostly going to be:

- **Video games** — playthroughs, history, industry thoughts
- **Gunpla** — current builds, reviews, tips
- **Baseball** — Braves season coverage and analysis
- **Comics and manga** — reading updates, recommendations
- **Work stuff** — business analysis, process improvement, data

No strict schedule. Posts when I have something worth saying.

## Why not Substack?

I looked at it. Ultimately I'd rather own my content on my own site than have it live on someone else's platform. Everything here lives in a git repo and will always be mine.

More soon.
